# Features:

It can make the maximum reachable money and collect ~500 golden eggs every hour without effort.

# How to use:

- I created this script with v6.2.6.4 of [Automatic Mouse and Keyboard](https://www.robot-soft.com/automatic-mouse-keyboard.html), use this version or newer.
- Use [BlueStack](https://www.bluestacks.com/) as an Android emulator. It may work with other emulators as well, but has not been tested
- Start the emulator before running the script
- All included pictures have been optimized for 1920x1080 resolution. If you use a different one, may you have to recognize pictures again
- Run the emulator in full screen
- Set the "Home" shortcut to "Crtl + Shift + H" in BlueStack
- Do not use the computer while the script runs. Press "Shift + F2" to stop it.
- I made this script in my free time. That was 10+ hours to create it. Please consider to **Donate me via [PayPal](https://paypal.me/BajzaFerenc)**. Thank you!
